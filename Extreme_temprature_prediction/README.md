# Temprature prediction using Neural Net
Temperature prediction is a common application of neural networks that involves using past data to predict future temperature values. Neural networks are particularly well-suited to this task because they can learn complex patterns and relationships in the data that may not be apparent to traditional statistical models. In this context, the input variables may include historical temperature data, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant factors that may affect temperature.

The neural network is trained using a dataset of historical temperature data, along with other relevant inputs. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the model and the testing set used to evaluate its performance. The model consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer consists of a number of neurons that perform mathematical operations on the inputs.

The neural network is trained using an optimization algorithm such as Adam,which adjusts the weights and biases of the neurons to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual temperature values. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and trends in the input data that are associated with changes in temperature. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new input data.

One of the challenges of temperature prediction is that it can be affected by many different factors, some of which may not be directly observable. For example, temperature can be affected by changes in atmospheric pressure, which may not be easily measured. Therefore, it is important to carefully select the input variables and ensure that they are relevant to the task at hand.

In summary, temperature prediction using neural networks is a powerful technique for predicting future temperature values based on historical data. It involves training a neural network using a dataset of historical temperature data, along with other relevant inputs, and then using the trained model to make predictions on new input data. This technique can be used in a wide range of applications, including weather forecasting, climate modeling, and building energy management.
